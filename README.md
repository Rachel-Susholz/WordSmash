# Word Smash
## Game Overview
Word Smash is an engaging word game where players guess hidden words by smashing buttons. The game is designed to be quick, fun, and stimulating, perfect for anyone looking for a light challenge. Players will be presented with a series of blank spaces, each representing a hidden word, and must choose the correct letters from a set of buttons to complete the word.
## Features
*Hidden Word Puzzle: Each round presents a series of blank spaces representing a hidden word. As players guess the letters, the spaces are filled in.

*Interactive Letter Buttons: Players can click on buttons with letters to guess the word.

*Score and Feedback: The game tracks the score, awarding points for correct guesses and deducting points for incorrect guesses. Players receive real-time feedback such as "Great Choice!" for correct guesses or "Try 
 Again!" for incorrect ones.

*Game Status: The status label dynamically updates to reflect the current game state, such as "Game Started" or "Game Over."

*Hint System: Players can use a hint button to reveal one letter of the word (to be implemented).
