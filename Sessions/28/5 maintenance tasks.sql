--AS Nice! 96% Please see all comments.
--Note: some of these scripts are needed for specific items, when the instructions say "specific" pick one item in your data and specify it in the where clause using a unique value that identifies it, do not use the primary key.

--1) Sometimes when a staff member is fired. We need to eradicate everything from that user in our system. Write the SQL to delete a specific user and all the user's related records.
--AS -2 This didn't work when I tried to run it. I got back "f_Recipe_CourseRecipe". Perhaps even though you deleted any meals that where created by the User, you still have some reciepes in 
    --that table that belong to the user. 
    --I didn't check if there are any other tables that are a problem, make sure it runs before resubmitting it.
    --I worked on this for a very long time. I saw that it didn't run, but I cant figure out the problem.

--2) Sometimes we want to clone a recipe as a starting point and then edit it. For example we have a complex recipe (steps and ingredients) and want to make a modified version. Write the SQL that clones a specific recipe, add " - clone" to its name.

3) We offer users an option to auto-create a recipe book containing all of their recipes. 
Write a SQL script that creates the book for a specific user and fills it with their recipes.
The name of the book should be Recipes by Firstname Lastname. 
The price should be the number of recipes multiplied by $1.33
Sequence the book by recipe name.

Tip: To get a unique sequential number for each row in the result set use the ROW_NUMBER() function. See Microsoft Docs.
	 The following can be a column in your select statement: Sequence = ROW_NUMBER() over (order by colum name) , replace column name with the name of the column that the row number should be sorted

4) Sometimes the calorie count of of an ingredient changes and we need to change the calorie total for all recipes that use that ingredient.
Our staff nutritionist will specify the amount to change per measurement type, and of course multiply the amount by the quantity of the ingredient.
For example, the calorie count for butter went down by 2 per ounce, and 10 per stick of butter. 
Write an update statement that changes the number of calories of a recipe for a specific ingredient. 
The statement should include at least two measurement types, like the example above.
