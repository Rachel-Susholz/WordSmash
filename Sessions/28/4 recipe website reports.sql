Our website development is underway! 
Below is the layout of the pages on our website, please provide the SQL to produce the necessary result sets.

Note: 
a) When the word 'specific' is used, pick one record (of the appropriate type, recipe, meal, etc.) for the query. 
    The way the website works is that a list of items are displayed and then the user picks one and navigates to the "details" page.
b) Whenever you have a record for a specific item include the name of the picture for that item. That is because the website will always show a picture of the item.
