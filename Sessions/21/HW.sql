/*
Create a database to keep track of rockets and their space journeys.
Keep it simple, omit any constraints.
Rocket has a name that is unique, and year built.
Journey has a planet name, distance traveled, launch date, date reached destination, date returned.
Populate with enough sample data to make aggregates interesting.
