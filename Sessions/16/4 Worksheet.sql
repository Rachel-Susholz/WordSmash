-- The following rules must be enforced:

-- World Record
-- 1. Two records cannot have the same Record Name, Unit of Measure, and Amount 


-- Invention 
-- 2. Year Invented must be between year born and year died

-- 3. Rerun the World Record and Invention data
-- Note: You may need to fix some data in order to rerun the data after these constraints are in place. Save these fixes in your Data files

-- 4. Test your World Record constraint! Try inserting two records with the same Record Name, Unit of Measure, and Amount 

-- 5. Test your Invention constraint! Try inserting bad data to prove that your constraint works
