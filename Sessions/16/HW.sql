Medalist 
   Recently somebody entered bad data into the medalist table (mixed up the year born and the olympic year),
   and that data was used to create an advertisement targeting an international audience.
   The advertisement was viewed by millions of people around the world. It was very embarassing.
   Strengthen the table in order to ensure that no bad data is ever inserted again.
   The following rules must be enforced:
      The year born must be before olympic year.
      The first olympic games happened in 1896. No data is allowed to be inserted before that.
      No null data is allowed.
      Columns should not allow blank data, zeros or negative numbers to be inserted. 
      Medalists must be at least 14 years old in order to compete in olympic games.
      Each olympic year and season can only have one of each medal for each sport and it's sport subcategory.
    After adding in the constraints, rerun the medalist data and include test scripts for the constraints to prove that you have succeeded in strengthening the table.

President
    The U.S Government used the data in the presidents table to provide the captions for new monuments engraved into the side of a mountain in NY.
    There was bad data in the table, some term ends and term starts were reversed. 
    So the caption engraved in the mountain says something like Served: 1900 to 1886. This was discovered on opening day by some of the audience.
    It is going to cost 1.4 million dollars to correct that error engraved into the mountain.
    Ensure all bad data possibilities are prevented.
    They have specified a few rules:
        No president's term can begin before 1776 when America became a country
        Term end cannot be before term start.
        A president must be at least 35 years old.

--    Include test scripts that demonstrate the strength of your reinforced table.
--    Good Luck!
