Add a table to record Executive Orders for Presidents. 

These are the essential elements of a standard 'executive order reference' that appears in the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.):
a) Order number (unique)
b) Volume number and name of the code in which the order appears (executive orders always in appear in 3 C.F.R.)
c) Page number
d) Year that the order was issued by Chief Executive
e) Name of the order

Hereâ€™s an example of the official format for an executive order reference:

Exec. Order No. 6102, 3 C.F.R. 5 1933. Forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States.

Also include columns that indicate:
	whether or not the executive order was upheld or struck down by the courts
	audit date time that record was created
Include all constraints to ensure the data is valid.

2) Add data to the table (you can use your imagination or look it up online), at least 6 rows with 3 of them belonging to one president.

3) reports and tasks
	a) list all executive orders sorted by page number, display the official executive order format
	b) same as (a) but include the presidents name
	c) same as (b) but include the party name
	d) show number of executive orders per president for presidents that issued 3 or more orders. sort by highest number of orders
	e) show number of executive orders per party
	f) pick a party that has one or more executive orders and delete the party
	g) for a particular party with exec orders update all to not upheld
