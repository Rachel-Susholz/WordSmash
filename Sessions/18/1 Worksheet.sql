I sell precious stones, each stone has a type, shape, color, and weight. 
I need to record the price I purchased it at, when I purchased it, when I sold it, and how much it sold for. 
I also need to see how long it took for me to sell it and how much profit\loss I made.

Now that I'll have my data organized, I'll need the following reports:
1) I need to know the number of stones sold to consumers vs to other dealers.
2) Show me the min, max, average days stones sat in inventory, per stone type?
3) Show me the profit\loss per stone, and also per stone type and shape

Questions:
1) What is the max and min weight of a stone?
    a) In my business max weight is 5.999, if anything bigger than that came through the door I would faint
    b) Min is .001, sometimes we deal with stone chips that are tiny
2) Would you ever receive a stone or give it away for free?
    a) Never happened and never will
3) Do you sometimes sell a stone knowing that you are receiving it, but do not yet have it inventory?
    a) No. Although we do have informal deals, this system is for recording real inventory and sales
4) What other types of customers would you have besides for Consumer and Dealer?
    a) That's it, just consumer and dealer
