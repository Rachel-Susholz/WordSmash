--re run the data before doing each question

--1 John F Kennedy was a hoax, delete him from the table and reduce the number for all subsequent presidents (requires two statements)

--2 Add "Short Term" to all republican presidents' first names for those who served less than 1 term (less than 4 years) after 1900.

--3 Breaking News: Robert Wilson really won the last election. End the term of the current president and enter Robert Wilson as the next president.

--4 Zoom to the future! Add grandchildren for each of the past presidents. They all have the same last name, and first name + Jr. Add to president number and all 'Years' and 'Terms' columns so that all data is (or at least could be) correct.

--5 Congratulations! You were elected for the next term. Add this record to the president table. Choose your party name and set 5 existing presidents to your party.
