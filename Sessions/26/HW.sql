/*
The government is starting a new program to award medals to presidents for outstanding service. 
Add tables to store medals and award them to presidents. A medal can be assigned to more than one president. 
When awarding a medal to a president record the date and time of the award.
A president cannot receive the same award more than once.

Medals:
	Made America Great
	(make up several more)

Ensure that sample data provides A) president with no medals
                                 B) president with only one medal
                                 C) president with multiple medals
                                 D) a medal shared by multiple presidents
                                 E) a medal that has never been awarded to a president
