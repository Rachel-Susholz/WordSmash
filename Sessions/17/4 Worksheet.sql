/* 1. We now need to store the Inventor's phone number, but it is not required due to the fact that 
      many inventors lived before phones were invented, this cannot be a required column.
      Add the column. do not allow null and default to blank.
      This column must allow dashes as well as numbers, so it cannot be an int column.

-- 3. Test the new default values by inserting a new record without specifying the new columns
