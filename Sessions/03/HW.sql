--Medalist

/* 1
An Olympic medalist would like to sue the International Olympic Committee because she was unable to claim her medal and prize money. 
After thoroughly investigating the matter, we discovered that there was a bug in our system.  
The bug caused that France was not able to distribute a medal to any of its Olympians that have 'S' as the second letter in their Medalist code. 
Show the medalist that is suing the Olympic Committee.
